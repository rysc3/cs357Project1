# Project 1 - Anagrams
## Ryan Scherbarth, Maisy Dunlavy, Molly Palko

## Current plan 
-- Anagrams game, using a generated sequence of characters the user will interact through brick to unscrammble the letters into as many words as possible
-- we can try to use a dictionary to confirm that the words the user is inputing are actual words and not just garbage
-- sets of unscrammbled letters will not be random, we can have a few sets that we alternate that have a lot of words that can be generated
--do we want a timer? a way to keep score?
-- we shall use brick
