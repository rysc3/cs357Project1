# Project 1 - Anograms
## Ryan Scherbarth, Maisy Dunlavy, Molly Palko

## GUI Library
- brick 

## Current plan 
-- Anagrams game, using a generated sequence of characters the user will interact through brick to unscrammble the letters into as many words as possible
--logic for making sure all the letters the user enters are part of the anagram thing

-- we can try to use a dictionary to confirm that the words the user is inputing are actual words and not just garbage

--search algorithm to check whether the word they entered works

-- sets of unscrammbled letters will not be random, we can have a few sets that we alternate that have a lot of words that can be generated
--do we want a timer? a way to keep score? 


-- can brick do all the event handling and graphics that we need for anagrams? or will we need to use both? 
from the program we have, how to we start implementing a user interface
